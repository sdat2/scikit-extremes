## Datasets

This packages datasets defines a set of packages which contain datasets useful
for demo, examples, etc... This can be seen as an equivalent of the ismev R
package, but for python. [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ismev/ismev.pdf]

There is also information from the paper:

* Harris, R. I. (1996) "[Gumbel re-visited - a new look at extreme value
statistics applied to wind speeds](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167610595000291)".
Journal of Wind Engineering and
Industrial Aerodynamics 59, 1-22.

For example, to access datasets engine, you should be able to do:

    from skextreme import datasets
    engine = datasets.engine()

`engine` will contain:

* a description (`engine.description`),
* the available fields of the dataset (in this case `engine.fields.corrosion`
and `engine.fields.time`) and
* a function to obtain all the fields as a numpy array (`engine.asarray()`).
